Therefore, the (ordinarily 2d) filtering kernel needs to be applied separately to each of these channels, giving it an effective depth of the number of channels. From the initial image, one can apply many different kernels at the same time, by introducing  a fourth dimension to the kernel, resulting in many different feature maps. So, the dimensions of the kernel are as follows (unordered): \n",
