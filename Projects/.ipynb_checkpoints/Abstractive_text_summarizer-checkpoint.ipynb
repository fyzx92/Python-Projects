    "# Text summarization overview\n",
    "Text Summarization can come in two main flavors. The first is extractive, which looks at the provided text, and selects some representative sentences from it. The other is abstractive, which generates its own sentences to summarize the provided text.\n",
    "\n",
    "By necessity, a text summarizer takes in a sequence, read word by wor, and outputs a sequence of a different length, making it a many to many problem, for which recurrent (LSTM) networks are particularly suited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The network has two segments, the encoder and the decoder, which can each be any of Recurrent, LSTM, or Gated Recurrent networks. The encoder reads the input text, and generates an internal representation, which could be regarded as the machine's understanding or interpretation of the text as a whole. The decoder then takes this representation and tries to summarize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem with encoder-decoders is that the entire input vector is converted and used for the decoder, which can result in very long sequences for it to memorize. We can reduce this effect by using an attention layer, which allows it to value some words over others as being more significant. Attention can be evaluated either locally or globally. This example will be global.\n",
