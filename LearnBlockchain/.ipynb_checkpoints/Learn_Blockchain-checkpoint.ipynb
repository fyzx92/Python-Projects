    "A blockchain is a linear chain of blocks, containing information. In the case of cryptocurrencies, this information is in the form of transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key form of value of a blockchain is that none of the blocks in the chain can be modified without [disconnecting, invalidating, changing downstream?].\n",
    "\n",
    "Each block in the chain includes data, a hash of the previous block, and a hash of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, if someone manages to change the data in a block, its own hash changes, and it creates a break in the chain, since the block that is supposed to come next no longer refers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To prevent someone from simply recalculating all of the downstream hashes, blockchains include a proof-of-work, in the form of something called Nonce. This is simply a number which causes the hash of the entire block to have some easily checkable property. \n",
    "\n",
    "This requires trying many many numbers (depending on the verification criterion), which slows down the creation of each block, making it prohibitively ineffective to try to edit existing blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the entire blockchain is stored in a distributed manner, meaning that each time someone tries to update the blockchain, it must agree with all the other copies of the blockchain."
